# NEXT.JS APP

A react meetup app, which includes a form which can be used to add a new meet-up, this app was an introduction to next.JS which i followed while taking a react guide course, and it was deployed using Vercel, it is also a dynamic site as a new meet-up is created it is displayed on the home, this was done with the help of getStaticProps which use a revalidate function to handle incoming request so the data seen by the user is current and not aged, we used getStaticPaths for dynamic pages and including a fallback of "blocking", which implies that all paths havent been specified so if you get a request generate a page for the request.
